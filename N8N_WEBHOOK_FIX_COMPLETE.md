# n8n Webhook Fix - Complete Resolution

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Ready for Testing

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: n8n Webhook Hanging
**Issue**: The n8n webhook at `https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app/webhook/vc-registry-scraper` was not responding to POST requests, causing indefinite hangs.

**Evidence**:
- Direct curl test showed connection established but no response after 19+ seconds
- SSL handshake completed successfully
- Data uploaded but no response body received
- Connection appeared to timeout without error

**Likely Causes**:
1. n8n workflow may not be ACTIVE (turned off)
2. Webhook trigger node not properly configured
3. n8n instance may be experiencing issues

### Problem 2: No Timeout on Webhook Calls
**Issue**: The `trigger-scrape` edge function called the n8n webhook without any timeout, causing:
- Edge function to wait indefinitely for response
- Jobs stuck in "running" state forever
- No error messages or failure status
- User unable to clear stuck jobs

### Problem 3: Inadequate Cleanup Mechanism
**Issue**: The existing `cleanup-stale-jobs` function had a 45-second timeout, which was too aggressive and could interfere with legitimate scraping jobs.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Timeout to Webhook Calls

**File**: `supabase/functions/trigger-scrape/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `AbortController` with 10-second timeout
- Wrapped webhook call in try-catch for proper error handling
- Updates job status to "failed" on timeout with descriptive error message
- Clears timeout properly to prevent memory leaks

**Key Code**:
```typescript
// Create AbortController for timeout (10 seconds)
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);

try {
  const response = await fetch(n8nWebhookUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({...}),
    signal: controller.signal  // üëà This enables timeout
  });

  clearTimeout(timeoutId);

  if (!response.ok) {
    // Handle error response
    await supabaseAdmin
      .from('scraping_jobs')
      .update({
        status: 'failed',
        error_message: `N8N webhook failed: ${errorText}`,
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
      })
      .eq('id', job.id);
  } else {
    // Success - update to running
    await supabaseAdmin
      .from('scraping_jobs')
      .update({ status: 'running' })
      .eq('id', job.id);
  }
} catch (webhookError) {
  clearTimeout(timeoutId);

  const isTimeout = webhookError instanceof Error && webhookError.name === 'AbortError';
  const errorMessage = isTimeout
    ? 'N8N webhook timeout (10s) - workflow may not be active'
    : `N8N webhook error: ${webhookError instanceof Error ? webhookError.message : 'Unknown error'}`;

  // Update job to failed with error message
  await supabaseAdmin
    .from('scraping_jobs')
    .update({
      status: 'failed',
      error_message: errorMessage,
      completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    .eq('id', job.id);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Jobs no longer hang indefinitely
- Clear error messages inform users of the issue
- Jobs properly fail after 10 seconds if webhook doesn't respond
- User can identify that n8n workflow may not be active

---

### 2. Updated Cleanup Timeout

**File**: `supabase/functions/cleanup-stale-jobs/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- Increased timeout from 45 seconds to 5 minutes
- Updated error messages to reflect new timeout
- Updated documentation

**Before**:
```typescript
const timeoutThreshold = new Date(Date.now() - 45 * 1000).toISOString();
error_message: "Job timed out after 45 seconds (auto-cleanup)"
```

**After**:
```typescript
const timeoutThreshold = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000).toISOString();
error_message: "Job timed out after 5 minutes (auto-cleanup)"
```

**Benefits**:
- More reasonable timeout for actual scraping jobs
- Won't interfere with legitimate long-running jobs
- Better balance between cleanup and allowing jobs to complete

---

### 3. Created Manual Cleanup UI

**New File**: `src/hooks/useCleanupJobs.ts`

Custom React hook for triggering manual cleanup:
```typescript
export const useCleanupJobs = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const cleanupStaleJobs = async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('cleanup-stale-jobs', {
      body: {}
    });

    if (data.cleaned === 0) {
      toast.info('No stuck jobs found to clean up');
    } else {
      toast.success(`Successfully cleaned up ${data.cleaned} stuck job${data.cleaned > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
    }

    return data;
  };

  return { cleanupStaleJobs, isLoading };
};
```

**Updated File**: `src/pages/DataSources.tsx`

Added "Clear Stuck Jobs" button to the "Recent Scraping Jobs" card header:
```typescript
<Button
  onClick={cleanupStaleJobs}
  disabled={isCleaningUp}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
>
  {isCleaningUp ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 animate-spin" />
      Cleaning...
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
      Clear Stuck Jobs
    </>
  )}
</Button>
```

**Benefits**:
- Users can manually clear stuck jobs without waiting 5 minutes
- Clear visual feedback with loading state
- Toast notifications inform users of results
- Button shows how many jobs were cleaned

## üéØ What This Fixes

### Before:
1. ‚ùå Jobs stuck in "running" state indefinitely
2. ‚ùå No way to clear stuck jobs manually
3. ‚ùå No error messages explaining why jobs failed
4. ‚ùå n8n webhook calls hung without timeout
5. ‚ùå Dashboard appeared broken with frozen jobs

### After:
1. ‚úÖ Jobs fail after 10 seconds if webhook doesn't respond
2. ‚úÖ "Clear Stuck Jobs" button allows manual cleanup
3. ‚úÖ Clear error message: "N8N webhook timeout (10s) - workflow may not be active"
4. ‚úÖ Webhook calls timeout properly with AbortController
5. ‚úÖ Dashboard shows job failures with reasons
6. ‚úÖ Users can identify n8n workflow is not active

## üîß Next Steps to Fix n8n Webhook

The webhook timeout fixes are in place, but the **root cause** is that the n8n workflow is not responding. Here's what you need to check:

### 1. Verify n8n Workflow is Active

**Steps**:
1. Open n8n at `https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app`
2. Navigate to your workflow
3. Check the toggle switch in the top-right corner
4. **Ensure it says "Active"** (not "Inactive")

**Why**: Inactive workflows don't respond to webhook triggers.

---

### 2. Check Webhook Trigger Configuration

**Steps**:
1. Open the webhook trigger node in your workflow
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Webhook Path**: `vc-registry-scraper`
   - **HTTP Method**: `POST`
   - **Authentication**: None (or match your setup)
   - **Respond**: Set to "Immediately" or "When Last Node Finishes"

**Expected Configuration**:
```json
{
  "webhookId": "vc-registry-scraper",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "path": "vc-registry-scraper",
  "responseMode": "onReceived"
}
```

---

### 3. Test Webhook URL Directly

**Test Production Webhook**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app/webhook/vc-registry-scraper" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobId": "test-123",
    "source": "CH",
    "registrySource": "COMPANIES_HOUSE",
    "searchTerm": "test",
    "filters": {},
    "callbackUrl": "https://utzxdzkebdgwxgqhieee.supabase.co/functions/v1/scrape-callback"
  }' \
  --max-time 5
```

**Expected Response** (if active):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Workflow triggered"
}
```

**Actual Response** (current):
- Connection hangs with no response
- Timeout after 10+ seconds

---

### 4. Check n8n Execution Logs

**Steps**:
1. In n8n, click "Executions" in the sidebar
2. Look for webhook trigger attempts
3. Check if any executions show as "Running" or "Error"
4. Review error messages if present

---

### 5. Alternative: Use Test Webhook URL

n8n provides both Production and Test webhook URLs:

**Production URL** (current):
```
https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app/webhook/vc-registry-scraper
```

**Test URL** (alternative):
```
https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app/webhook-test/vc-registry-scraper
```

**To Use Test URL**:
1. Set environment variable in Supabase:
   ```
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n-ffai-u38114.vm.elestio.app/webhook-test/vc-registry-scraper
   ```
2. Note: Test webhooks work even when workflow is inactive

---

## üìä Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Webhook Timeout Handling

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Data Sources page
2. Click "Run Scrape for UK Companies House"
3. Wait 10 seconds

**Expected Result**:
- Job appears with status "running" initially
- After 10 seconds, job status changes to "failed"
- Error message: "N8N webhook timeout (10s) - workflow may not be active"
- Toast notification shows failure

**Verify in Supabase**:
```sql
SELECT id, status, error_message, started_at, completed_at
FROM scraping_jobs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 2. Test Manual Cleanup

**Steps**:
1. Create some test jobs (will fail due to webhook timeout)
2. Wait for jobs to show as "failed"
3. Click "Clear Stuck Jobs" button in Recent Scraping Jobs section

**Expected Result**:
- Button shows loading state
- Toast notification: "No stuck jobs found to clean up" (if all already failed)
- Or: "Successfully cleaned up X stuck job(s)" (if any were still running)

---

### 3. Test When n8n is Fixed

**After fixing n8n workflow**:
1. Ensure workflow is ACTIVE in n8n
2. Test the webhook with curl (should respond immediately)
3. Click "Run Scrape" in dashboard
4. Job should:
   - Start as "pending"
   - Change to "running"
   - Complete with entities scraped
   - Show "completed" status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### The Fix is NOT Complete Until:
1. ‚úÖ Code fixes are deployed (DONE)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **n8n workflow is activated and responding** (NOT DONE - THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Webhook responds to test requests
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Jobs complete successfully end-to-end

### Current State:
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Fixed - proper timeout and error handling
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Fixed - manual cleanup button added
- **n8n Workflow**: ‚ùå NOT WORKING - needs to be activated/fixed

---

## üéì Summary

The dashboard code is now robust and handles webhook failures gracefully. However, **you still need to fix the n8n workflow** for scraping to actually work.

The fixes ensure:
- Jobs don't hang forever when n8n doesn't respond
- Users get clear error messages
- Manual cleanup is available
- System is resilient to external service failures

**Next Action**: Go to your n8n instance and activate the workflow, then test again.
